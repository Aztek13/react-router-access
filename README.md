# React Router Access

A route access and navigation management solution for react-router (v4+).
Project is aimed to solve next problems:
1. Route permissions management. Access rules definition per route which can be connected to redux store.
2. Reduction of the code duplications for the react-router routes definitions.
3. Navigation management. If user doesn't have an access to some module of the application, developer can easely wrap components or their parts with access connector - react-router-access will define itself if it should be rendered based on the defined route permissions.

React router v4 allowed to do distribution of the route descriptions and to keep them inside of the components. This project was designed to be used with a logic of [a https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux](ducks-modular-redux). It allows you better isolate and separate your routing management.
